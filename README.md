# BoxInvert

## Description
An OpenCV computer vision tool for advanced image inversion.

## Background
I use a system-wide dark gruvbox theme, and so I like all my applications to use a dark theme. This includes my note-taking application which compiles markdown using a custom stylesheet. This stylesheet is configured with gruvbox colours, and so notes look like this:

![markdown viewer](screenshots/md-viewer.png)

However, when I paste an image from somewhere on the internet, chances are it will have an ugly white background.

One solution is to add a css rule to invert every image, which results in this:

![poorly inverted image](screenshots/bad-invert.png)

I'd like an easy way to invert only parts of an image, and that's why I created
this tool, which gives the following image,

## Usage

I've made a simple video tutorial demonstrating the usage of the program:
